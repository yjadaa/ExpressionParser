My Expression Parser is wokring for all the required equations but there are limitations.
it is working for square root, power, and fraction, and other simple add, subtract and multiplay
but for fraction there are some limitations becasue there is no time to complete my code.
limitations are:
>>>the numbers on fraction should be 1 digit each and there are no sqaure roots, or pow , or fractions on the denominator and numerator
>>>the fraction should be the first thing to be done, if it is the second or later then it will not work.

The way my system works: 
>>>user can write one equation only then he/she clicks the recognize button, and the equation should be ended with = sign
the output equation with the result will be printed on the output text box

>>>user can select the equation with the selection tool from editing and moved it with your finger

>>>user can use scribbling gesture from the eiditng and delete the sympol

>>>sympols must be written in orders from left to right in order to be recognized correctly.

>>>Sympols must be written clearly

>>>I attached some mathematical expressions as samples for my Expression Parser.
